tSNE notes:

t-SNE (TSNE) converts affinities of data points to probabilities. The affinities in the original space are represented by Gaussian joint probabilities and the affinities in the embedded space are represented by Studentâ€™s t-distributions.


The computer treats each gene as a dimension. Gene with similar gene expression will be clustered together. We need to be able to see these clusters in 3 dimensional space so it makes sense to our brains.
